## Project Name

A Triangle-Tracker

## Portfolio Description

This project helps in knowing whether a triangle is Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene or NOT a triangle. This is all based on the input (in the pop-up) of the measurements of the three different sides of the triangle.

## Author's Information

The author of the code (Elizabeth Andiko) is currently a software development student at Moringa School.

## Setup Instructions

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Behaviour Driven Development

The programs specifications includes:
First prompting the user to input the measurements of the three sides of the triangle.
If the input figure is not a value, then its not a triangle.
If it passes the value condition then it moves to the function.
For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.
For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
Most importantly, if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values.

## Technologies Used
